/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to setup a keyboard with two
 text fields and how to manage their focused state.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.

 ðŸ’¡ The project only links KeyboardKit Pro to the app target,
 while the base library is linked to all targets that use it.
 Since KeyboardKit Pro is a binary library, this is how it's
 supposed to be linked, since extensions can still locate it.
