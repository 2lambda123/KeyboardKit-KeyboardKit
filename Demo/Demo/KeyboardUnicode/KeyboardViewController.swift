/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard that is
 using a `SystemKeyboard` to mimic a native Unicode keyboard.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.

 Note that this demo adds KeyboardKit as a local package, to
 make it easy to test and develop the library from this demo.
