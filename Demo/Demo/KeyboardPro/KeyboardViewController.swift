 This keyboard controller inherits ``ProDemoViewController``,
 which registers a KeyboardKit Pro license to unlock a bunch
 of Pro features, like multiple locales, autocomplete etc.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.
