/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard that is
 using a `SystemKeyboard` to mimic a native English keyboard.

 Since the ``DemoKeyboardViewController`` sets up a standard
 configuration, this class doesn't have to override anything.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.
 
 Note that this demo adds KeyboardKit as a local package, to
 make it easy to test and develop the library from this demo.
