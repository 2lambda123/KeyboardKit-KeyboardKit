/**
 This view uses a `SystemKeyboard` as the keyboard view.
 
 The setup function will actually register a `SystemKeyboard`
 by default if you don't provide a view when calling `setup`.
 
 This custom view is just here to show you how you can setup
 a custom view. Play around with the body content to see how
 the keyboard extension changes.
