/**
 This view sets up a `SystemKeyboard` as a keyboard view and
 adds an `AutocompleteToolbar` above it.

 The keyboard will look and behave as is defined by services
 and configurations in the ``ProDemoViewController``.

 While the `SystemKeyboard` is very flexible, it can also be
 easily created by just providing it with a controller, like
 we do here. The standard configuration adds an autocomplete
 toolbar topmost and uses an emoji keyboard whenever needed.
