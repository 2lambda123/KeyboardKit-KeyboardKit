/**
 This view wraps a `SystemKeyboard`, which aims to mimic the
 native iOS keyboard as closely as possible.

 While the `SystemKeyboard` is very flexible, it can also be
 easily created by just providing it with a controller, like
 we do here. This configuration adds an autocomplete toolbar
 above the keyboard and replaces the system keyboard with an
 emoji keyboard whenever needed.
