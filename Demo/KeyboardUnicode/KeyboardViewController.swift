/**
 This SwiftUI-based demo keyboard demonstrates how to create
 a unicode-based keyboard.
 
 The demo makes demo-specific configurations in `viewDidLoad`
 and sets up the keyboard with a `KeyboardView`. Play around
 with the demo to see how the keyboard changes.
 
 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access if you
 want to enable haptic and audio feedback.
 
 `IMPORTANT` The `KeyboardView` is needed to ensure that the
 keyboard observes and reacts to context changes. If we just
 inject a `SystemKeyboard` in `setup`, it would become stale.

     the input set provider that we registered earlier.
