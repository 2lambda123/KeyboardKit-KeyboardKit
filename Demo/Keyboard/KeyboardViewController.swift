/**
 This SwiftUI-based demo keyboard demonstrates how to create
 a keyboard extension using `KeyboardKit` and `SwiftUI`.
 
 This demo registers demo-specific services in `viewDidLoad`
 and sets up KeyboardKit with a `KeyboardView` that uses the
 services in `viewWillSetupKeyboard`. Feel free to play with
 these to see how the keyboard behavior changes.
 
 The demo can be configured with and without KeyboardKit Pro
 support. Without Pro, the demo only supports English locale
 and uses a fake autocomplete engine. With Pro, the demo has
 support for all locales and uses a real autocomplete engine.
 Just comment out `setupPro` to disable Pro support.
 
 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access if you
 want to enable haptic and audio feedback.

 `IMPORTANT` The `KeyboardView` has many environment objects
 that make it automatically update when these objects change.
 The `KeyboardViewController` will not trigger these changes
 automatically, so make sure to define your own app-specific
 view that can setup these bindings.

     Some configurations will be overridden by registering a
