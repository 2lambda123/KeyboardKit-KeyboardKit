# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecated code will only be removed in `major` versions.
* Breaking changes should not happen in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

These release notes will only contain the current version. Just check out an older branch or version tag to access older release notes. 



## 8.0

This version removes all previously deprecated functions and aims to make the library more discoverable.

This version also moves a lot of types into namespaces and grouping types, which will also make the surface area smaller. 

Some nice-to-have utilities that bloated the library while providing little value have been removed. If you need them, just grab them from an earlier version.

### ðŸš¨ Important information

* Renamed and moved types have temporary typealiases to help you migrate from KeyboardKit 7. 
* Just follow the deprecation warnings after upgrading. These typealiases will be removed in 8.1.
* If you use a custom action handler with Pro, make sure to inherit the new `ProKeyboardActionHandler`. 
  
* `KeyboardInputViewController` moves state properties into a new `keyboardState` property.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` moves services properties into a new `keyboardServices` property.
* `ProKeyboardActionHandler` is a new keyboard action handler with Pro-specific action handling.
* `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` no longer registers the most recently used emojis. This has moved to Pro.
* `SystemKeyboard` provides MUCH easier customizations, but must be provided with explicit view builders.
* `SystemKeyboard` no longer adds an emoji keyboard, since this component has been moved to Pro.
* `SystemKeyboard` no longer hides or configures the autocomplete toolbar. Do this in the new `toolbar` view builder.
