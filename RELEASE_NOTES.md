# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecated code will only be removed in `major` versions.
* Breaking changes should not happen in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

These release notes will only contain the current version. Just check out an older branch or version tag to access older release notes. 



## 8.0

This version removes all previously deprecated functions and aims to make the library more discoverable.

Many types are moved into new namespaces, which will help reduce the surface area of the library. 

Renamed and moved types have temporary typealiases to help you migrate from KeyboardKit 7. Just follow the deprecation warnings after upgrading and you should be fine. These typealiases will be removed in 8.1.

Some nice-to-have utilities that bloated the library while providing little value have been removed. If you need them, just grab them from an earlier version.
