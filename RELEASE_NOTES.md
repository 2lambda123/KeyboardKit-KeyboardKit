# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecated code will only be removed in `major` versions.
* Breaking changes should not happen in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

These release notes will only contain the current version. Just check out an older branch or version tag to access older release notes. 



## 8.0

This version removes all previously deprecated functions and aims to make the library more discoverable.

This version also moves many types into namespaces and parent types, which will make the library easier to overview. 

Some nice-to-have utilities that bloated the library while providing little value have been removed, such as types that only served to exposed functionality to DocC.

If you need any removed functionality, just grab them from an earlier version of KeyboardKit.

### ðŸš¨ Important information

* Renamed and moved types have temporary typealiases to help you migrate from KeyboardKit 7.
* Just follow the deprecation warnings after upgrading, and your code should migrate properly.
* These typealiases will be removed in 8.1, so make sure to go from 7.x to 8.0 to get this help. 
* If you use a custom action handler with Pro, make sure to inherit the new `ProKeyboardActionHandler`.
  
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has moved state properties into a new `state` property.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has moved services properties into a new `services` property.
* `ProKeyboardActionHandler` is a new keyboard action handler with Pro-specific action handling.
* `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` no longer registers most recent emojis. This has moved to Pro.
* `SystemKeyboard` provides MUCH easier customization, but must be given explicit view builders.
* `SystemKeyboard` no longer adds an emoji keyboard, since this component has been moved to Pro.
* `SystemKeyboard` no longer hides or configures the autocomplete toolbar. You can do this in the new `toolbar` view builder.
