# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecated code will only be removed in `major` versions.
* Breaking changes should not happen in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

These release notes will only contain the current version. Just check out an older branch or version tag to access older release notes. 



## 8.0

Welcome to KeyboardKit 8.0 - a massive update to the KeyboardKit library.

KeyboardKit 8.0 is all about cleaning up and polishing the library to make it more approachable, better structured and easier to use.

This version removes all previously deprecated code, reorganizes types into namespaces for a streamlined library, and removes low-value utilities, such as types that only helped exposing functionality to DocC. This has helped reducing the codebase by about 25%.

Some central types, including `SystemKeyboard`, are much easier to use. You can for instance pass in state and services directly into the system keyboard, reducing memory leak risks by eliminating the need to pass around a controller. However, the controller‚Äôs setup function still offers an unowned reference for safetly accessing state and services.

To make things even easier, the `SystemKeyboard` no longer needs an explicit width. It will now take up as much space as it can horizontally, and as much as it needs vertically. It also makes it a lot easier to provide a custom toolbar and emoji keyboard.

All in all, these updates simplify future scaling of the library and has already enabled a new feature that fades out the system keyboard button labels while moving the input cursor with the space key. The next minor update will also support floating keyboards on iPad.

There are many quality of life improvements. Accessibility has been drastically improved when typing on the keyboard, and the emoji keyboard has been redesigned to look a lot more like the native keyboard.

And speaking of emojis, many emoji features, including the emoji keyboard and category information, are now Pro features. The system keyboard will automatically remove the emoji key if an emoji keyboard isn't provided.

Finally, the documentation has gotten a big overview, and will now provide you with a lot more information, more code examples, etc. Please reach out if you find any inconsistencies in the documentation, since much has changed in this version.


### üí° Migrating from KeyboardKit 7

Before you upgrade to KeyboardKit 8.0, it may be a good idea to upgrade to the last 7.x version, since it contains now removed deprecations and types.

KeyboardKit 8.0 includes temporary deprecations to assist migration from KeyboardKit 7. Follow the deprecation warnings for a proper code migration. 

These temporary deprecations will be removed in 8.1, so make sure that you always upgrade to 8.0 before upgrading to a later version.

If you run into breaking changes, please refer to the breaking changes section below.
