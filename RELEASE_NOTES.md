# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecated code will only be removed in `major` versions.
* Breaking changes should not happen in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

These release notes will only contain the current version. Just check out an older branch or version tag to access older release notes. 



## 8.0

This version removes all previously deprecated functions and aims to make the library cleaner and more discoverable.

One big change is that many types are moved into new namespaces, which will help reduce the surface area of the library.

Renamed and moved types have temporary migration typealiases to help you migrate from KeyboardKit 7. These typealiases will be removed in 8.1.

Renamed and moved types are not included in these release notes. Just follow the deprecation warnings after upgrading and you should be fine. 

Some nice-to-have utilities have also been removed, if they bloated the library while providing little value. If you need them, grab them from an earlier version.

Note that the library no longer sets up English services by default, so make sure that you are aware of that before upgrading. You must either implement these services yourself, or get them by upgrading to KeyboardKit Pro.
