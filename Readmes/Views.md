# Views

KeyboardKit comes with a bunch of keyboard-specific views, for instance:

* `Autocomplete` is a namespace that contains autocomplete toolbars and toolbar items.
* `Callouts` is a namespace that contains input and secondary input callout views.
* `Emojis` is a namespace that contains various emoji keyboards and keyboard components.
* `Input` is a namespace that contains text inputs that can be used in a keyboard extension.
* `System` is a namespace that contains views that can be used to mimic native systme keyboards. 
* `KeyboardGrid` can be used to evenly space a set of views in a grid.
* `NextKeyboardButton` can be used to switch to the next keyboard.

You can also use these views without using the rest of KeyboardKit.
