These locales can be accessed with the `KeyboardLocale` enum.


## Localized strings

KeyboardKit has a `KKL10n` enum that provides localized strings for all locales. These texts are used to localize certain buttons, labels etc.

Localized strings are managed under `Sources/Resources`.


## Localized keyboards

A completely localized keyboard doesn't just involve localized strings.

To fully localize a keyboard, you must implement a locale-specific input set, keyboard layout, callout actions etc.

While KeyboardKit only provides a completely localized English keyboard, [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] provides completely localized keyboards for all keyboard locales.


## How to add a new locale

Adding a new locale to KeyboardKit requires the following:

* Define the new `KeyboardLocale` case.
* Define its properties, like `flag`, `isLeftToRight` etc.
* Provide a `Resources/<id>.lproj` folder with localized strings.
* Implement a custom `CalloutActionProvider`.
* Implement a custom `InputSetProvider`.

If the locale generates a keyboard that looks off, you can either implement a new `KeyboardLayoutProvider` or adjust the `iPhoneKeyboardLayoutProvider` and `iPadKeyboardLayoutProvider` to handle the new layout.

New locales must ensure that the keyboard layout is correct for:

* iPhone portrait
* iPhone landscape
* iPad portrait
* iPad landscape  

This involves specifying margins, system actions etc. to make the keyboard behave correctly for all these cases.


## KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro provides completely localized keyboards for all keyboard locales, including locale-specific input sets, keyboard layouts and callout actions.
