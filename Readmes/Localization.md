These locales can be accessed with the `KeyboardLocale` enum.

Each locale provides localized strings and locale information. KeyboardKit Pro then provides support for fully localized input sets, keyboard layouts, callout actions etc.


## Localized strings

KeyboardKit has a `KKL10n` enum that provides localized strings for all locales. These texts are used to localize certain buttons, labels etc.

Localized strings are stored in `Sources/Resources`.


## Localized keyboards

A completely localized keyboard doesn't just involve localized strings. To fully localize a keyboard, you must implement locale-specific input sets, keyboard layouts, callout actions etc.

While KeyboardKit only provides localized strings, locale information and a localized English keyboard, [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] provides completely localized keyboards for all keyboard locales. 


## How to add a new locale

Note that `KeyboardContext` don't rely on the KeyboardKit-specific `KeyboardLocale`, but rather on the general `Locale` type. This means that you don't need to add more `KeyboardLocale`s to create keyboards that are localized in oher languages.

However, if you DO need to add a new `KeyboardLocale`, there are a number of things that you need to do, as mentioned above. Please see the documentation for more information.


## KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro provides completely localized keyboards for all keyboard locales, including locale-specific input sets, keyboard layouts and callout actions.
