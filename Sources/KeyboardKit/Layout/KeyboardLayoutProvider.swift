 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can return
 keyboard layouts for the keyboard extension's current state.
 
 KeyboardKit registers a standard protocol implementation in
 the input view controller's `context` when the extension is
 started. You can replace this at any time, by registering a
 new priovider with the `keyboardLayoutProvider` property.
