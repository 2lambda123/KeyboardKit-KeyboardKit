/**
 This keyboard layout provider bases its layout decisions on
 factors like device, screen orientation and locale. It aims
 to create a system keyboard layout for the provided context,
 which is not always what you want.
 
 This provider only supports locales that are also supported
 by the `StandardKeyboardInputSetProvider`, which means that
 non-supported locales will get the standard keyboard layout
 for English keyboards.
 
 This provider will fallback to lowercased alphabetic layout
 if the current context state doesn't have a standard layout.
 One example is if the current keyboard type is `.emojis` or
 another non-standard keyboard. Make sure to check for these
 states your self, and only use this for standard use cases.
 
 If you want to create a custom keyboard extension that does
 not rely on standard system keyboard conventions, you could
 register a custom layout provider or just ignore the entire
 layout provider concept altogether.
 
 You can inherit and customize this class to create your own
 provider that builds on this foundation.
