/**
 A keyboard layout lists all available actions on a keyboard.
 It's most often made up of multiple input button rows and a
 set of surrounding system system buttons.
 
 A keyboard layout depends on the current locale, device and
 orientation etc. It's therefore more complicated to resolve
 a layout than an input set. Us
