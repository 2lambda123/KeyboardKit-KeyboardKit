/**
 This view is meant to be used within a `SystemKeyboard` and
 will apply the correct frames and paddings to make the view
 behave well within an automatically generated keyboard view.
 
 This view wraps a `SystemKeyboardButtonContent` and adjusts
 it to be used within a keyboard row. This involves applying
 height and paddings and new gestures in a way that make the
 buttons seem separated while actually sticking together.
