# Understanding Layout

This article describes the KeyboardKit layout engine.

A flexible keyboard layout is an important part of a software keyboard, where many factors like device, screen orientation, locale, etc. can all affect the layout.

In KeyboardKit, ``InputSet``s and ``KeyboardLayout``s are important concepts to create a flexible keyboard layout, where the input set specifies the input keys of the keyboard and the keyboard layout specifies the full set of keys.

KeyboardKit will bind a ``StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider`` to ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` when the keyboard is loaded. It has a QWERTY layout by default, but you can inject localized providers into it or modify it, or replace it, at any time.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks and registers localized input sets and layout providers. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Input Sets

An ``InputSet`` set specifies the input keys of a keyboard.

KeyboardKit has some input sets, like ``InputSet/qwerty``, ``InputSet/standardNumeric(currency:)`` and ``InputSet/standardSymbolic(currencies:)``. You can also create your own custom input sets.



## Keyboard layouts

A ``KeyboardLayout`` specifies the full set of keys of a keyboard. 

Keyboard layouts can vary greatly for different device types, screen orientations, locales, etc. For instance, iOS keyboards often have 3 input rows, where the input keys are surrounded by actions on either side, as well as a bottom row with a space key and action buttons. 

This is however not true for all locales. For instance, Armenian has 4 input rows, Greek removes many side-buttons, Arabic removes the shift key, etc. These differences can be significat, so the layout engine has to be flexible. 



## Hot to custome the keyboard layout

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardLayoutProvider`` can be used to create a dynamic layout based on many different factors, such as the current device type, orientation, locale, etc. 

You can customize the keyboard layout by adding localized providers to the default ``StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider``, or by replacing the ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` provider with a custom ``KeyboardLayoutProvider``.



## How to create a custom callout action provider

You can create a custom ``KeyboardLayoutProvider`` by inheriting ``StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider`` and customize what want, or implement the ``KeyboardLayoutProvider`` protocol from scratch.

There are also other base classes, such as ``BaseKeyboardLayoutProvider``, ``InputSetBasedKeyboardLayoutProvider``, ``iPadKeyboardLayoutProvider`` and ``iPhoneKeyboardLayoutProvider``. 

For instance, here's a custom provider that inherits ``StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider`` and injects a tab key into the layout:

```swift
class CustomKeyboardLayoutProvider: StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider {
    
    override func keyboardLayout(for context: KeyboardContext) -> KeyboardLayout {
        let layout = super.keyboardLayout(for: context)
        var rows = layout.itemRows
        var row = layout.itemRows[0]
        let next = row[0]
        let size = KeyboardLayout.ItemSize(width: .available, height: next.size.height)
        let tab = KeyboardLayout.Item(action: .tab, size: size, insets: next.insets)
        row.insert(tab, at: 0)
        rows[0] = row
        layout.itemRows = rows
        return layout
    }
}
```

To use this provider instead of the standard one, just set the ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` provider to this custom provider:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
services.keyboardLayoutProvider = CustomKeyboardLayoutProvider()
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.



## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a ``KeyboardLayoutProvider`` for each locale in your license.

KeyboardKit Pro automaticallys inject all providers from your license into the ``StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider``, to make it support all locales.


### How to access your localized providers

You can access all localized providers in your license like this:

```swift
let providers = License.current.localizedKeyboardLayoutProviders
```

or any locale-specific provider like this:

```swift
let provider = try ProKeyboardLayoutProvider.Swedish()
```

Note that your license must include the locale, otherwise the provider will throw a license error.  


### How to customize a localized provider

You can inherit and customize any localized provider, to customize that specific locale:

```swift
class CustomProvider: ProKeyboardLayoutProvider.Swedish {

    override func keyboardLayout(for context: KeyboardContext) -> KeyboardLayout {
        var layout = keyboardLayoutProvider(for: context)
            .keyboardLayout(for: context)
        layout.tryInsertFlag(for: context)
        return layout
    }
}

private extension KeyboardLayout {

    func tryInsertFlag() {
        guard let button = tryCreateBottomRowItem(for:  .character("ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª")) else { return }
        itemRows.insert(button, after: .space, atRow: bottomRowIndex)
    }
}
```

You can register this provider *after* registering your license key, to customize that specific locale:

```swift
class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()

        setupPro(withLicenseKey: "...") { license in
            setupCustomProvider()
        } view: { controller in
            // Return your keyboard view here
        }
    }

    func setupCustomProvider() {
        do {
            let provider = try CustomKeyboardLayoutProvider()
            let standard = services.keyboardLayoutProvider as? StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider
            standard.localizedProviders[.swedish] = provider
            services.keyboardLayoutProvider = standard
        } catch {
            print(error)
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the standard provider cast will fail if you replace it.
