# Styling

This article describes the KeyboardKit styling engine and how to use it.

KeyboardKit uses ``KeyboardStyle`` types to style various views. For instance, a ``KeyboardStyle/InputCallout`` style can be used to style ``InputCallout`` views. 

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` can be used to defines the styles, texts, icons etc. for different parts of the keyboard. It can adapt styles depending on ``KeyboardContext``, ``KeyboardAction`` etc., which gives you a lot of flexibility.

KeyboardKit will by default create a ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider`` and apply it to the input controller's ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardStyleProvider``. You can replace it with a custom provider to customize how your keyboard looks.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] specific features, such as the convenient theme engine, are described at the end of this document.



## Styles vs. themes

You may find yourself confused by the style and theme terminology. Let's clarify what they are and how they are meant to be used. 

* A ``KeyboardStyle`` type is a *static* style that can be applied to one or many different kind of views.
* A ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` is a *dynamic* style provider that can return styles (and more) for various parts of the keyboard.
* A ``KeyboardTheme`` (Pro) is a *static* style provider that can be used to define, reuse and share styles. It can be used with a ``ThemeBasedKeyboardStyleProvider`` to add a dynamic capabilities on top of the static theme. These utilities are only available in KeyboardKit Pro.

You can mix and match these different concepts as you see fit.



## Resources & Assets

KeyboardKit comes with colors and images that make it easy to create native-looking keyboards.

* `Image` has a bunch of static, keyboard-specific images, e.g. `.keyboardBackspace`.
* `Color` has a bunch of static, keyboard-specific colors, e.g. `.standardButtonBackgroundColor(for:)`.
* ``KeyboardAction`` and other types have standard images, texts and colors, for instance:

```swift
let context = KeyboardContext()
let image = KeyboardAction.command.standardButtonImage(for: context) // Command icon
let text = KeyboardAction.space.standardButtonText(for: context)     // Localized "space"
```

Have a look at the `Sources/Resources` and `Sources/Styling` folders for more information.



## How to customize styles

The ``KeyboardStyle`` namespace defines a bunch of styles, such as ``KeyboardStyle/Button``, while other namespaces define more contextual styles. For instance, the `Emojis` namespace defines an ``EmojiKeyboardStyle``.

Any style can be modified, as long as it's a `var`. For instance, here we adjust the standard ``CalloutStyle`` to use a red background:

```swift
var style = CalloutStyle.standard
style.backgroundColor = .red
CalloutStyle.standard = style
```

Most styles have a `.standard` style that you can use as a template. The standard styles can also be overwritten with a custom style to change the global style of that component.



## How to create a custom style provider

You can create a custom ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` by either inheriting the ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider`` base class and customize the parts you want, or implement the ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` protocol from scratch.

For instance, here's a custom provider that inherits ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider`` and makes all input buttons red:

```swift
class CustomKeyboardStyleProvider: StandardKeyboardStyleProvider {
    
    override func buttonStyle(
        for action: KeyboardAction,
        isPressed: Bool
    ) -> KeyboardStyle.Button {
        let style = super.buttonStyle(for: action, isPressed: isPressed)
        if !action.isInputActionÂ { return style }
        style.backgroundColor = .red
        return style
    }
}
```

To use this provider instead of the standard one, just set the input controller's ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardStyleProvider`` to your custom provider, like this:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        keyboardStyleProvider = CustomKeyboardStyleProvider()
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.



## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

### Themes

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a theme engine that makes it a lot easier to define styles for a keyboard. The theme engine comes with several predefined themes and also lets you easily define your own, custom themes.

A ``KeyboardTheme`` can be used to define a bunch of styles, such as button and background styles. KeyboardKit comes with many pre-defined themes, like `.standard`, `.minimal`, `.swifty` and more playful ones like `.candyShop`, `.neon` and `.tron`:

```swift
KeyboardTheme.standard
KeyboardTheme.swifty
KeyboardTheme.minimal
KeyboardTheme.candyShop
KeyboardTheme.neon
KeyboardTheme.tron
```

All pre-defined themes come with style variations that allow you to tweak the overall style of a theme:

```swift
KeyboardTheme.standard(.pink)
KeyboardTheme.swifty(.blue)
KeyboardTheme.minimal(.midnight)
KeyboardTheme.candyShop(.cottonCandy)
KeyboardTheme.neon(.night)
KeyboardTheme.tron(.sark)
```

You can also define a custom style variation directly in the theme initializer:

```swift
KeyboardTheme.standard(.init(tint: .black))
```

Style variations make it easy to play within the overall style of a theme, and only modify the parts that are allowed to change by the theme.


### Custom themes

You can create completely custom themes, like this one that just changes the color of the primary button:

```swift
extension KeyboardTheme {
    static var myCustomTheme: KeyboardTheme {
        get throws {
            var theme = try? KeyboardTheme(
                primaryBackgroundColor: .green
            )
        }
    }
}
```

You can also use another theme as a template and tweak any parts of it:

```swift
extension KeyboardTheme {
    static var anotherTheme: KeyboardTheme {
        get throws {
            var theme = try? KeyboardTheme.standard
            theme.buttonStyles[.primary]?.backgroundColor = .green
            return theme
        }
    }
}
```

You can then access your themese with `KeyboardTheme.myCustomTheme` or just `.myCustomTheme` when a theme is expected.


### Theme-based styling

Once you have a theme that you want to use, you can use the ``ThemeBasedKeyboardStyleProvider`` to apply any theme to your keyboard:

```swift
override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
    super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()

    // Setup KeyboardKit Pro with a license
    try? setupPro(withLicenseKey: "LICENSE_KEY_HERE") { _ in
        keyboardStyleProvider = ThemeBasedKeyboardStyleProvider(
            theme: .cottonCandy,
            keyboardContext: keyboardContext
        )
    }
}
```

This will make any view that uses the style provider (like ``SystemKeyboard``) use this theme. You can change the theme at any time. 

Since this requires KeyboardKit Pro, you must register it *after* setting up your license. 

You can inherit ``ThemeBasedKeyboardStyleProvider`` to customize this theme-based provider even further, which lets you mix the benefits of themes and styles in any way that fits your needs.


### Pre-defined themes

You can access all pre-defined themes with `KeyboardTheme.{ID}`, for instance `KeyboardKit.standard` or `KeyboardKit.minimal(.pink)`. Here are all pre-defined themes with some style variations:

| Theme        |                               |                                        |                                |                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | 
| `.standard`  | ![Standard](standard.jpg)     | ![Standard](standard-blue.jpg)         | ![Standard](standard-pink.jpg) | ![Standard](standard-green.jpg) | 
| `.swifty`    | ![Swifty](swifty.jpg)         | ![Swifty](swifty-blue.jpg)             | ![Swifty](swifty-pink.jpg)     | ![Swifty](swifty-green.jpg)     | 
| `.minimal`   | ![Minimal](minimal.jpg)       | ![Midnight](minimal-blue.jpg)          | ![Sunset](minimal-sunset.jpg)  | ![Sunset](minimal-midnight.jpg) | 
| `.candyShop` | ![Candy Shop](candyshop.jpg)  | ![Cuppy Cake](candyshop-cuppycake.jpg) |                                |                                 |
| `.neon`      | ![Neon](neon.jpg)             |                                        |                                |                                 | 
| `.tron`      | ![Tron](tron.jpg)             | ![fCon](tron-fcon.jpg)                 | ![virus](tron-virus.jpg)       | ![virus](tron-sark.jpg)         |

You can get all pre-defined themes with `KeyboardTheme.allPredefined`. Theme-specific styles also have an `allPredefined` with all style variations for a certain theme, e.g. `KeyboardTheme.SwiftyStyle.allPredefined`.


### Views

KeyboardKit Pro has a ``KeyboardThemeLivePreview`` that you can use to preview themes in Xcode or display themes to the user. It will render a system keyboard with full interation, which means that it's quite heavy to render. You can use the more lightweight ``KeyboardThemeButtonPreview`` to preview many themes at the same time.


### License Requirements

The KeyboardKit Pro theme engine requires a `Gold` license.
