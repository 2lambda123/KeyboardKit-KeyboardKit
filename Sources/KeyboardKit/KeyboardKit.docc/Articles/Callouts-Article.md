Callouts are an important part of the typing experience, where input callouts show the currently pressed character and action callouts show secondary actions when certain keys are long pressed.

In KeyboardKit, a ``CalloutActionProvider`` can provide actions, which in turn will update views like ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` by updating the current ``CalloutContext``.

## Callout namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Callouts`` namespace that has callout-related types and views. For instance, an ``Callouts/InputCallout`` can present the currently pressed character while an ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` can present secondary actions while long pressing a key.

This namespace doesn't contain protocols, open classes or types of higher importance.



## Callout context

KeyboardKit has an observable ``CalloutContext`` class that provides observable input and action callout state, such as the currently pressed key or the callout actions to present.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, then updates this context when keys are pressed.



## How to provide callout actions

In KeyboardKit, a ``CalloutActionProvider`` can be used to provide dynamic callout actions, which are then presented when a key that has actions defined in the provider is long pressed.

KeyboardKit injects a ``StandardCalloutActionProvider`` into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can modify or replace this instance at any time.

You can add and replace localized providers to the ``StandardCalloutActionProvider``, or replace the ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` provider with a custom ``CalloutActionProvider``.



## How to show input and action callouts

You can apply a `.keyboardCalloutContainer` view extension to make any view act as the container of input and action callouts:

```swift
MyKeyboard()
    .keyboardCalloutContainer(...)
```

This will bind a ``CalloutContext`` to the view, then apply ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` and ``Callouts/InputCallout`` views that show as this context changes. There are also separate input and action-specific container extensions.

The ``SystemKeyboard`` and ``KeyboardButton/Button`` will automatically apply the proper extensions and update the context as you interact with them.



## How to create a custom callout action provider

You can create a custom callout action provider to customize the callout actions to present for a certain ``KeyboardAction``.

You can implement ``CalloutActionProvider`` from scratch, or inherit and customize ``StandardCalloutActionProvider``.

For instance, here's a custom provider that inherits ``StandardCalloutActionProvider`` and customizes the actions for **$**:

```swift
class CustomCalloutActionProvider: StandardCalloutActionProvider {
    
    override func calloutActions(for action: KeyboardAction) -> [KeyboardAction] {
        switch action {
        case .character(let char):
            switch char {
            case "$": return "$â‚½Â¥â‚¬Â¢Â£â‚©".chars.map { KeyboardAction.character($0) }
            default: break
            }
        default: break
        }
        return super.calloutActions(for: action)
    }
}
```

To use this provider instead of the standard one, just inject it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        services.calloutActionProvider = CustomCalloutActionProvider()
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.



## Views

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Callouts.ActionCallout") {
        
        KeyboardKit has an ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` that mimics a native action callout and can be used to present secondary actions for any key.
        
        ![ActionCallout](actioncallout-350.jpg)
        
        The view can be customized and styled with a ``Callouts/ActionCalloutStyle``, which is applied with `.actionCalloutStyle`:
        
        ```swift
        Callouts.ActionCallout {
            ...
        }
        .actionCalloutStyle(...)
        ```
    }
    
    @Tab("Callouts.InputCallout") {
        
        KeyboardKit has an ``Callouts/InputCallout`` that mimics a native input callout and can be show the currently pressed key.
        
        ![InputCallout](inputcallout-350.jpg)  
        
        The view can be customized and styled with a ``Callouts/InputCalloutStyle``, which can be applied with `.inputCalloutStyle`:
        
        ```swift
        Callouts.InputCallout {
            ...
        }
        .inputCalloutStyle(...)
        ```
    }
}




## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a localized ``CalloutActionProvider`` for every locale in your license, and automatically injects them into the ``StandardCalloutActionProvider``.

You can access all localized providers in your license, or any specific provider, like this:

```swift
let providers = License.current.localizedCalloutActionProviders
let provider = try ProCalloutActionProvider.Swedish()
```

> Important: These providers will throw a license error if their locale is not included in the license.


### How to customize a localized provider

You can inherit and customize any localized provider, then manually register your provider *after* registering your license key:

```swift
class CustomProvider: ProCalloutActionProvider.Swedish {

    override func calloutActionString(for char: String) -> String {
        switch char {
        case "s": return "sweden"
        default: return ""
        }
    }
}

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()

        setupPro(withLicenseKey: "...") { license in
            setupCustomProvider()
        } view: { controller in
            // Return your keyboard view here
        }
    }

    func setupCustomProvider() {
        do {
            let provider = try CustomProvider()
            let standard = services.calloutActionProvider as? StandardCalloutActionProvider
            standard?.registerLocalizedProvider(provider)
        } catch {
            print(error)
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the provider cast will fail if you replace the instance with your own type.
