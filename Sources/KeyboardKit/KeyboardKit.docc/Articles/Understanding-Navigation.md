# Understanding Navigation

This article describes the KeyboardKit navigation engine.

You may sometime have to open an url from the keyboard, or to navigate from the keyboard to the main app, and vice versa.

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardUrlOpener`` that can be used to open URLs from the keyboard extension, without `UIApplication`.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a `PreviousAppNavigator` that can be used to navigate back to the previous app, e.g. after dictation. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## How to open URLs from the keyboard extension

The ``KeyboardUrlOpener`` class can be used to open URLs from a keyboard without having to use `UIApplication`.

The class has a ``KeyboardUrlOpener/shared`` instance that can be used from anywhere.

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://keyboardkit.com")
try? KeyboardUrlOpener.shared.open(url)
```

This is used by the Pro dictation engine, to navigate from the keyboard to the main app to start dictation.



## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a `PreviousAppNavigator` that can be used to navigate back to the previous app, e.g. after dictation.

This is a protocol, so any type can implement it:

```swift
struct ContentView: View, PreviousAppNavigatorÂ {

    var body: some View {
        Button("Go back") {
            do {
                try navigateBackToPreviousApp()
            } catch {
                print(error)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is used by the Pro dictation engine, to navigate from the main app back to the keyboard to finish dictation.

> Warning: As of iOS 17, the PreviousAppNavigator doesn't work anymore. Make sure to adjust your UI accordingly, until it's replaced by a working solution.
