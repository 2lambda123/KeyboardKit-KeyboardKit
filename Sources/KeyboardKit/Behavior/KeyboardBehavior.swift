/**
 This protocol can be used to specify behavior rules for the
 keyboard. It aims to separate behavior from action handling
 to make the code cleaner and more understandable.
 
 KeyboardKit automatically creates an implementation of this
 protocol and binds it to ``KeyboardInputViewController``.
 
 `IMPORTANT` Whenever you replace the standard behavior with
 your own custom behavior, make sure to do so before calling
 any other services that depend on the behavior, or recreate
 the services that do depend on it.
