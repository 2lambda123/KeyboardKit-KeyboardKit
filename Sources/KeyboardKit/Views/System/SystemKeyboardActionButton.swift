/**
 This view mimics the buttons that are used in an iOS system
 keyboard. It wraps a `SystemKeyboardButton` view and uses a
 `SystemKeyboardActionButtonContent` to resolves its content.
 
 You can use the `contentConfig` to customize the content in
 the button to fit your needs.
 
 The view uses the provided `context` and `actionHandler` to
 perform actions when the button is tapped, which means that
 you can create this button anywhere and it will trigger the
 correct gesture actions for tap, long press, drag etc.
 
 `SystemKeyboardButton` can be used to create a basic button
 that just looks correct, but doesn't do anything.
