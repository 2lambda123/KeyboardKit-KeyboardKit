/**
 This view mimics the buttons that are used in an iOS system
 keyboard. It wraps a `SystemKeyboardButton` view and uses a
 `SystemKeyboardActionButtonContent` to resolves its content.
 
 Note that this view only mimics the look of a system button
 for the provided `action` and `appearance` and does not add
 any gestures or button actions to itself. When you do apply
 gestures, make sure to change `isPressed` accordingly. This
 is easiest to do by creating your own wrapper view.
 
 You can use the `contentConfig` to customize the content in
 the button to fit your needs.
 
 `SystemKeyboardButton` can be used to create a basic button
 that have a fixed content and style.
