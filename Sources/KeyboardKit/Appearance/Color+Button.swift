/**
 This file contains keyboard-specific color extensions.
 
 `IMPORTANT` The KeyboardContext `colorScheme` becomes wrong
 when `keyboardAppearance` is `.dark` and the device runs in
 `.light` mode. The keyboard extension will be told that the
 colorScheme is `.dark` instead of `.light`.

 This is WRONG, since "dark appearance" keyboards should NOT
 look the same in light mode and dark mode. However, this is
 how iOS sets up the extension and not a bug in KeyboardKit.
 
 Until this is fixed, set the `Color.darkAppearanceStrategy`
 to a custom strategy if you want to customize KeyboardKit's
 standard strategy of always applying dark appearance colors
 when dark mode is enabled.
