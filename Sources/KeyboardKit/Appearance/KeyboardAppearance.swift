/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to provide appearance information for keyboard actions.
 
 Unlike a style, an appearance is contextual. It requires an
 implementation, while a style is just a struct. You can use
 an appearance to generate styles that can be applied to the
 keyboard and its buttons.
 
 KeyboardKit automatically creates an implementation of this
 protocol and binds it to ``KeyboardInputViewController``.
 
 `TODO` From KeyboardKit 6.0, the various styles will be put
 into a single `SystemKeyboardStyle` property, so that it is
 easy to just return `.standard` in custom appearances.
