 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to retrieve appearance properties for a keyboard.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 and bind it to the input view controller when the extension
 is started. It can be replaced with a custom one by setting
 the `keyboardAppearance` property.
