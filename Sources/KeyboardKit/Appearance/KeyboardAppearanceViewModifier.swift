/**
 This modifier can be used to set a keyboard appearance of a
 view to control if it will use a light or dark color scheme.

 Although this type is named like ``KeyboardAppearance``, it
 has nothing to do with keyboard styling, but rather aims to
 use the same namings as the `keyboardAppearance` properties
 of `UITextView` and `UITextField`.

 You can apply the modifier with `.keyboardAppearance(.dark)`
 to apply a dark keyboard appearance.
 
 To affect the text color of the text field/editor, you must
 apply a `foregroundColor` before applying this modifier.
