/// This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can
/// return autocomplete suggestions as the user types.
///
/// Simply call ``autocompleteSuggestions(for:)`` to perform
/// an autocomplete operation that returns suggestions for a
/// text in the current ``locale``.
///
/// Words can be learned using ``learnWord(_:)`` and ignored
/// using ``ignoreWord(_:)``. Learned words are persisted in
/// the system, and will be considered as new words from the
/// point they are learned, while ignored words will just be
/// ignored by the autocomplete provider.
///
/// Not all autocomplete providers support ignoring/learning
/// words. Check ``canLearnWords`` and ``canIgnoreWords`` to
/// check whether or not a provider supports it. Also, while
/// a provider may support ignoring and learning, it may not
/// be able to provide ``ignoredWords`` and ``learnedWords``.
///
/// KeyboardKit does not have a standard provider, as it has
/// for other services. Instead, a disabled provider will be
/// used until you register a custom provider, or register a
/// valid KeyboardKit Pro license key.
