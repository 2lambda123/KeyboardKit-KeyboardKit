 This provider is used by default, and provides the standard
 secondary callout actions for the current locale, if any.
 
 Note that this implementation only accepts and returns char
 actions, since that is what the built-in callout supports.
 
 You can inherit and customize this class to create your own
 provider that builds on this foundation.
