/**
 This class simplifies creating callout action providers, by
 providing a set of utility functions.
 
 You can inherit this class and override any open properties
 and functions to customize the callout actions. The easiest
 way is to override ``calloutActionString(for:)`` and return
 a string with all callout characters. This string will then
 be split by ``calloutActions(for:)`` and mapped to keyboard
 actions, which are then returned up the call stack.
 
 ``EnglishCalloutActionProvider`` uses this logic to specify
 which actions to use for U.S. English.
