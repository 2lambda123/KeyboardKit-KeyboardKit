 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to get secondary callout actions for a keyboard action.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 when the keyboard input view controller is created. You can
 use the standard instance as is or replace it with a custom
 one if you want to customize your keyboard.
