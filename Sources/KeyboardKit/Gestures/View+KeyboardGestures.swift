     - Parameters:
       - action: The keyboard action to trigger.
       - actionHandler: The keyboard action handler to use.
       - actionCalloutContext: The action callout context to affect, if any.
       - inputCalloutContext: The input callout context to affect, if any.
       - isInScrollView: Whether or not the gestures are used in a scroll view, by default `false`.
       - isPressed: An optional binding that can be used to observe the button pressed state.
