 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 keyboard actions.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 when the keyboard extension is started and register it with
 the input view controller. It can be replaced with a custom
 one by setting the input view controller `actionHandler` to
 a new value.
