 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 keyboard actions.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 when the extension is started and bind it to the input view
 controller. It can be replaced with a custom one by setting
 the input view controller's `actionHandler` property.
