/**
 This context can be used to handle dictation state for both
 the app and its keyboard extension.

 This single context is used by both the ``DictationService``
 as well as the ``KeyboardDictationService``. Make sure that
 you are using the correct initializer for your use-case.

 For an app, you must manually create an instance, using the
 initializer that suits your use-case. For an app to be able
 to sync data with a keyboard extension, make sure to use an
 app-specific ``KeyboardDictationConfiguration``.

 For a keyboard extension, KeyboardKit will setup a standard
 context instance, without any app-specific information. You
 must then call ``setup(with:)`` to configure the context to
 use an app-specific ``KeyboardDictationConfiguration``.
