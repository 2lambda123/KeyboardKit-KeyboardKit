/// This service does not work in keyboard extensions, since

/// See <doc:Autocomplete-Article> for information on how to

/// KeyboardKit does not have a standard provider, as it has

/// will be used until you register a real one or register a
/// valid KeyboardKit Pro license key.
///
/// To create a custom implementation, either implement this
/// protocol from scratch, or inherit any of the Pro classes
/// and override anything you want to change, then inject it
/// into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` to make it
/// the global default.
