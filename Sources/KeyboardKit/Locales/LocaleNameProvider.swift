 This protocol can be implemented by any type that should be
 able to provide localized names for locales.

 Implementing the protocol will extend the implementing type
 with functions that use public `Locale` extensions with the
 same name as these extensions. This protocol aims to expose
 these `Locale` extensions, which are otherwise not included
 in the generated documentation.
