 This enum contains various haptic feedback types.
  
 You can call ``trigger()`` on any feedback value to trigger
 the desired feedback, using the ``player``. You can replace
 this player with any custom player if you need to.

 Note that `macOS`, `tvOS` and `watchOS` resolves a disabled
 ``HapticFeedbackPlayer`` by default, since the platforms do
 not support haptic feedback. Feel free to replace it with a
 player that does something meaningful on each platform.
