/**
 This enum contains various audio feedback types.
  
 You can call ``play()`` on any value to trigger the desired
 feedback, using the static ``player``. You can replace this
 player with any custom player if you need to.

 Note that `watchOS` creates a ``DisabledAudioFeedbackPlayer``
 by default, since the platform doesn't support system audio.
 You can replace it with another player, that does something
 meaningful on that platform.
