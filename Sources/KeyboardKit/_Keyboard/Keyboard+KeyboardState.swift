     This type is used to retain keyboard state instances.
     
     This lets us decouple the primary input controller from
     any views that require many properties from it. You can
     configure the state instances at any time.
     
     Instead of passing the entire controller instance, pass
     in ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``.
     
     > Important: Only use the class as a transfer mechanism.
     Never store instance of it, but copy any properties you
     need and/or pass it on. Storing instances can lead to a
     reference cycle and memory leaks.
