 Keyboard stack view components are "rows" that can be added
 to your `KeyboardInputViewController`'s `keyboardStackView`.
 Some examples are button rows, toolbars etc.
 
 `TODO` The standard height and padding properties are valid
 for views that don't implement this protocol as well, but I
 want to isolete these new features to UIKit in this part of
 the process, to avoid risking side-effects.

     any top and bottom padding that should be added to your

     correct padding within itself and apply gesture support
     to its entire body.
