 In KeyboardKit, a `Keyboard` is just an action carrier with
 an optional id. The actions can be displayed in any way.
 
 In the demo application, you can see how you can extend the
 keyboard class with more functionality, e.g. so that it can
 suggest a preferred stack view distribution mode, provide a
 set of real buttons given its actions etc.

        self.id = id
        self.actions = actions
    }
    
    public let id: String?
    public let actions: [KeyboardAction]

public extension Keyboard {
    
    static var empty: Keyboard {
        return Keyboard(actions: [])
