/*
 
 Keyboard action handlers are used to handle keyboard action
 events that are triggered by the user.
 
 `addTapGesture(for:to:)` and `addLongPressGesture(for:to:)`
 can be used to add action gestures to button views that you
 add to your keyboard extensions. They will send any actions
 that the user triggers to the action handler.
