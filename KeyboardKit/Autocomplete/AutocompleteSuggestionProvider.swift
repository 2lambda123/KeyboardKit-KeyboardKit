/*
 
 This protocol can be implemented by anyone that can provide
 autocomplete suggestions based on a certain text.
 
 When using the protocol in a keyboard extension, you should
 call `provideAutocompleteSuggestions(for:)` whenever a user
 changes the text in the text document proxy.
 
 You can use the proxy's `currentWord` extension to find out
 which word the user is (most probably) currently typing.
