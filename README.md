KeyboardKit is a Swift library for iOS keyboard extension apps. It is currently
limited to the functionality I need in my own keyboard extension apps, but feel
free to extend it with more features.

KeyboardKit also contains functionality for creating a wrapper app, that can be
used to select emojis from a collection view. This is nice to have, if the user
doesn't want to give the keyboard extension full access.



## Example

To run the demo project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example
directory first. Note that the demo project is empty and only verifies that the
pod compiles properly.



## Requirements

KeyboardKit requires iOS 8 or later.



## CocoaPods

KeyboardKit will be added to CocoaPods as soon as it is used by emoji apps that
are live on the app store. My two emojo apps currently use the same source code,
but embedded in each app.
