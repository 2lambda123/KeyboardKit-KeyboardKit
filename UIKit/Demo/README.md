# KeyboardKit UIKit Demo

This demo is used to verify that KeyboardKit's UIKit support works well.


## UIKit support

KeyboardKit 4.0 shifts focus from `UIKit` to `SwiftUI`. 

UIKit is still supported, but I will not be working on these parts of the library anymore.

I will accept pull requests that improve UIKit support, as long as they don't have side-effects on the foundation.
